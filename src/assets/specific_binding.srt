00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,789
the ligand but this time we will add
cold ligand the cold ligand is exactly

176
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:06,799
cold ligand the cold ligand is exactly

177
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,130
cold ligand the cold ligand is exactly
the same as the hot ligand except that

178
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:09,140
the same as the hot ligand except that

179
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,309
the same as the hot ligand except that
it doesn't have the radio label in

00:04:11,309 --> 00:04:11,319
it doesn't have the radio label in

181
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:13,839

addition we will add a lot more of the

addition we will add a lot more of the

183
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:16,529

there's quite a lot going on here so we

186
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:19,519
there's quite a lot going on here so we

187
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,219
there's quite a lot going on here so we
will focus in on the receptors and

188
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:21,229
will focus in on the receptors and

189
00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:30,559
will focus in on the receptors and

as with the hot ligand the cold ligand

193
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:38,610
as with the hot ligand the cold ligand
molecules also move around constantly

195
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,650
when a cold ligand encounters an empty

196
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:41,660
when a cold ligand encounters an empty

197
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,990
when a cold ligand encounters an empty
receptor it will bind in the same way

198
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,000
receptor it will bind in the same way

199
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,110

that the hot ligand does and as hot

200
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,120
that the hot ligand does and as hot

201
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,050
that the hot ligand does and as hot

203
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,170

be taken back old ligand importantly

be taken back old ligand importantly

205
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,020
be taken back old ligand importantly
because there is much more cold ligand

206
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:56,030
because there is much more cold ligand

207
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,839
because there is much more cold ligand
than hot ligand at equilibrium

208
00:04:58,839 --> 00:04:58,849
than hot ligand at equilibrium

209
00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:01,089
